# The_Flappy_bird_game_clone
This is a Pygame-based implementation of a Flappy Bird-style game, where players control a bird navigating through a series of pipes by flapping its wings.

Gameplay:

Objective: Guide the bird through gaps between green pipes while avoiding collisions. Score points by passing through each pair of pipes.
Controls: Press the SPACE key to make the bird flap its wings and ascend. Gravity pulls the bird downward when not flapping.
Start Mechanism: The game begins in a "ready" state, displaying instructions ("Press SPACE to start" and "Press SPACE to flap and avoid pipes"). The game only starts when the player presses the SPACE key, triggering the bird's first flap.
Game Over: The game resets if the bird collides with a pipe, hits the ground, or flies too high. The previous score is displayed on the start screen after a game over.
